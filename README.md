# All-American-Project
Contains all the code for my Intro to Data Science final project about D3 track and field All-Americans in 2022. All code was written by my partner, Andrew Skemp, or myself. 
We scraped data from TFRRS and the NCSA website. TFRRS or the Track and Field Results Reporting System is a database with results from track meets starting in the early 2000s. We used TFRRS as our primary data website. In order to track the results of the national qualifiers from the 2022 track and field seasons, we took progression data from four primary events: the 100 meter dash, the 400 meter dash, the 1500 meter run, and the 10,000 meter run. Along with these four events, we took data from the indoor 60 meter hurdles, 60 meter dash, and the indoor mile to determine if these races had any correlation with the outdoor results. All together, we gathered progression data from the entire seasons of 48 All-Americans and 120 national championship qualifiers. Along with these events, we grabbed the qualifying information for all 380 participants in the 2022 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship.
The project will be published until we graduate from St. Olaf. If still published, you can see it here: https://rconnect.stolaf.edu/content/fa6cd77d-5f76-4f56-adcb-1a5aefbb6e87/
